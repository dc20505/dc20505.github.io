[Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) is a wonderful game-based service that challenges users to start by exploring the Linux command line through progressively challenging problems. In each problem the user must execute an appropriate command or exploit to reveal the password for the next level. Each wargame builds upon skills learned in the previous one, so it is recommended that you approach them in the order below. Additionally, the point of these games is to learn, so you should try to find the answers on your own first - much of IT security is about figuring out how to find the answer rather than the answer itself.
