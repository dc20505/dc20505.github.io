[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) is a service that offers numerous machines that are purposely exploitable, but are far less direct than OTW Wargames. There may be multiple solutions to a puzzle, and progress is tracked via the submission of flags. HTB also offers services to emulate live networked environments so that a user may practice something similar to live penetration testing, and there are guided tutorials to help hone skills.

>**Note:** In accordance with **Hack the Box**'s [guidelines](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5188925-c-streaming-writeups-walkthrough-guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://www.hackthebox.com/tos), only **Retired Content** will be described here. If live machines or challenges are discussed, they will be hidden behind password or other authentication method. Any exposure of live content is purely accidental and I will happily remedy it at HTB's request.
