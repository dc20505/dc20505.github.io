Below is a list of writeups I've constructed to help others learn skills related to information security. Some authors will put the answers in clear-text, but my hope is that by at least providing the steps that a user will perform them and learn something in their pursuit of the answer.

I'll be starting with [Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) challenges and then later add intermittent [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machines and challenges.

## OTW - Over the Wire 

[Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) is a wonderful game-based service that challenges users to start by exploring the Linux command line through progressively challenging problems. In each problem the user must execute an appropriate command or exploit to reveal the password for the next level. Each wargame builds upon skills learned in the previous one, so it is recommended that you approach them in the order below. Additionally, the point of these games is to learn, so you should try to find the answers on your own first - much of IT security is about figuring out how to find the answer rather than the answer itself.

## HTB - Hack the Box 
[Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) is a service that offers numerous machines that are purposely exploitable, but are far less direct than OTW Wargames. There may be multiple solutions to a puzzle, and progress is tracked via the submission of flags. HTB also offers services to emulate live networked environments so that a user may practice something similar to live penetration testing, and there are guided tutorials to help hone skills.
